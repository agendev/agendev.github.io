        <h2>Seasoned Tofu Website</h2>
        <p>Our UI/UX Designer, Cole Hastings, set out to create a personal website for his fitness brand that would appeal to his target audience.</p>
        <div class="dropdown-container">
          <h2>The Design Process</h2>
          <p>Using Adobe XD, a popular UI design software, Cole started to design the wireframe (the basic flow of the website). He had to take into account how the users would get to each page, and allow them to do so without any difficulties.</p>
          <img alt="Seasoned Tofu Wireframe" src="assets/wireframedesign.JPG"/>
          <p>With the wireframe in mind, Cole was able to design a modern, mobile responsive website, with a different landing header photo on each page, each showcasing different gym exercises.  This design uses gradient background "swooshes" to add a little more pop to the website, and makes it look much more visually appealing.</br>  The fonts used (Raleway and Bebas Neue) were also taken into consideration when deploying the final design.  These are fonts that appeal most to the people who he would be using the website most (18-30 years old, vegan, into fitness), because they're sharp and modern.

          <h2>The Design Process</h2>
          <p>Adobe XD was used to design the look of Zaparelli.  The interface that was required for this project included a "Top Zappers" Page, which acts as a high score system.  "Zapping" another profile ranks them higher on this page.  </p>

            The website was built using an AngularJS front end, NodeJS+Express back end, and a MYSQL database.

          <p>I worked together with 3 teammates at the Cornell University's annual 48 hour hackathon to build Academic Live Chat. ALC is a web application built with MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS, SocketIO, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Watson provides a variety of features to connect you with someone to talk about a topic of similar interest.</br>
          The application uses profile matching through user account similarities and Socket IO to pair individuals. Socket IO is also used for messaging and peer to peer video chatting between users.</p>
