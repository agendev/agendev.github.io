        <h2>Seasoned Tofu Website</h2>
        <p>Our UI/UX Designer, Cole Hastings, set out to create a personal website for his fitness brand that would appeal to his target audience.</p>
        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <p>Using Adobe XD, a popular UI design software, Cole started to design the wireframe (the basic flow of the website). He had to take into account how the users would get to each page, and allow them to do so without any difficulties.</p>

        <p>With the wireframe in mind, Cole was able to design a modern, mobile responsive website, with a different landing header photo on each page, each showcasing different gym exercises.  This design uses gradient background "swooshes" to add a little more pop to the website, and makes it look much more visually appealing.</br>  The fonts used (Raleway and Bebas Neue) were also taken into consideration when deploying the final design.  These are fonts that appeal most to the people who he would be using the website most (18-30 years old, vegan, into fitness), because they're sharp and modern.
